In today's github post there are some of the pattern questions.
According to me if you are not able to build logic at problem solving in java, patterns are the easiest way to enhance,
& build your skill.

Here are some of the pattern questions:

Sample input :
N = 5  (For all the patterns).

Sample output :

1) * * * * *        2)            *        3)         1                     4) *                5) *     
     * * * *                    * *                 2   3                      * *                 * *
       * * *                  * * *               4   5   6                    * * *               *   *
         * *                * * * *            7    8    9   10                * * * *             *     *      
           *              * * * * *          11   12   13   14   15            * * * * *           * * * * *                    
                                                                               * * * * 
                                                                               * * *        
                                                                               * *
                                                                               *
This and all are the questions & i think it's quite easy we all can do this type of problem but at the other hand it's the master concept to build 
logic behind the problem solving.
I have tried to code these patterns as easy as possible so that anybody see it should all get the concept & logic behind the questions needed to solve it.
Just use the concept of nested for loops.
