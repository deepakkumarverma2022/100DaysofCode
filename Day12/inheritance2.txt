It is a simple program on inheritance, which tells you to take two integer value as parameter inside add method of super class i.e. Arithmetic class.
And then tells us to return the sum of the taken integer as parameter.

And then make a children class that extends your Arithmetic class inorder to inherit the property of parent class.
That's it.


Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin;
a locked code stub will test your submission by calling the add method on an Adder object and passing it 2 integer parameters.

Output Format

You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. Your add method must return the sum of its parameters.

Sample Output

The main method in the Solution class above should print the following:

My superclass is: Arithmetic
42 13 20
