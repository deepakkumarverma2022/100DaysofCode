In this program I have simply dealt with the concept of If else.

That is taken a user input as integer & if number is even & lies in the range of 2 to 5 & also number is greater than 20.
Then print Not Weird.
Otherwise if number is even & lies in the range of 6 to 20 & also it is odd number.
Then print Weird.

Explanation

Sample Case 0: n = 3
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1: n = 24
n > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
