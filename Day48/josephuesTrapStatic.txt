In this question we are assembling given number in a circular manner & need to find the last kth number left after killing every 
kth integer which has been assembled in circular form.

Sample Input 1:

N = 8, k = 3 
     1
8        2
7           3
 6       4
     5   
     
Sample Output 1:
7



Sample Input 2:

N = 9, k = 4
       1
 10           2
                 3
6                     
                 9
   8          4
        5     
           
Sample Output 2:
1

Explanation :
In this program we have to find the last kth number left i.e. taking N is equal to the number of element in a circular path.
Then we are taking K value i.e. around which we have to kill the element, in the second input like we will start killing every 4th element present in the group.
And after killing we will not consider it for the second time, like this the number left until last will be the final output.
