WAP to print the given pattern.

Sample Input:
N = 5

Sample output:
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

Explanation :
In this program you just have to follow one pattern i.e. (11)^i, that you will iterate using for loop from i = 0 to i < n;
Using Math.pow() function it will give output in floating point so for converting it into Integer type, you'll have to explicitly
Convert it using (int)Math.pow(11,i); & store it in any variable let say var & then print it usingSystem.out.println(var);
And it's done.
