In this question we have simply solved three questions using recursion inside same MainClass.
(i) Find the sum of n natural number
(ii) Calculate power using recursion a^b in O(log n) time complexity
(iii) Find all the paths in a (n x m) grid

Sample Input 1:
N = 5

Sample Output 1:
1+2+3+4+5 = 15

Sample Input 2:
a = 3, b = 6

Sample output 2:
729

Sample Input 3:
n = 4, m = 4

Sample Output 3:
20


Explanation :
Just created a main class inside that created three function sum(), fastpow() & path(), inside sum function first checked for if (n == 1) 
which has been passed inside the sum() function as parameter then if (n==1) it will return sum = 1;
and rather than 1 any other natural number will be there then it will be sum using that function call
and similarly with other two function in which we passed the parameter int a, int b for fastpow() function & int n, int m for path() function to find the all possible
path in the grid.
