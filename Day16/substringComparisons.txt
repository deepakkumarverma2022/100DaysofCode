In this program I have taken a String s as input suppose "welcometojava" & k as a integer input for the length of substring from the taken string as input.
And now created a getSmallestAndLargest() function in which I have passed String s, int k.
A string,s, and an integer,k, complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length k

Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting s.
The second line contains an integer denoting k..

Sample Input 0

welcometojava
3
Sample Output 0

ava
wel
Explanation 0

String s = "welcometojava" has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length k = 3:
["ava", "com", "elc", "eto", "jav", "lco", "met", "oja",
We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).

The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.
