In this program You are given a class Solution with a main method.
Complete the given code so that it outputs the area of a parallelogram with breadth B and height H. You should read the variables from the standard input.

Input Format :
There are two lines of input. The first line contains B:the breadth of the parallelogram. 
The next line contains H:the height of the parallelogram.

Output Format
If both values are greater than zero, then the main method must output the area of the parallelogram.
Otherwise, print "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.

Sample input 1 :
1
3
Sample output 1 :
3

Sample input 2 :
-1
2
Sample output 2 :
java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive


Explanation :
First of all initialized a boolean variable flag & then taken a user input B for breadth & H for height using scanner class.
Then inside a try block according to the question given checked if(B<=0 || H <= 0) then initialize flag with false;
& throw a exception "breadth & height must be positive" else flag = true;
And then in the main method checked if(flag) it means if flag is equal to true then multiply B*H & print the area.
