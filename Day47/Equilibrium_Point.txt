In this question given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibrium Point in an array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 

Output: 3 

Explanation:  
equilibrium point is at position 3 
as elements before it (1+3) = 
elements after it (2+2). 
 

Example 2:

Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}

Output: 1

Explanation:
Since its the only element hence
its the only equilibrium point.
 

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function equilibriumPoint() which takes the array and n as input parameters and returns the point of equilibrium.
Return -1 if no such point exists.


Explanation :
Simply checked a condition if array of length i.e. n is less than equal to 1, return 1
Then initialized a sum variable with 0 & runs a for loop from 0 to less than n, and storing the sum after each iteration in the last closing the for loop.
And then took a another variable ls & initialized it with 0, & again runs a for loop from 0 to less than n.
And this time subtracting the array element from sum & checking & checking each time is sum equals to ls as ls is initially initialized with 0,
so, if sum doesn't matches ls then increase the ls value by adding arr[i], & if sum matches ls return the index of that position i.e. i+1 as loop is being 
started from 0 & hola it's done.
