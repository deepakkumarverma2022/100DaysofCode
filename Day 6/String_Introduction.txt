In this program given a two input string A & B.
We have to sum the length of string A & B for the first line.
For the second line I just compare the string A & B, using compareTo function to check 
whether the string A is lexicographically/alphabetically greater than string B or not.
If it is greater then print "Yes", "No" otherwise.
Then in the last for the third line, we have to capitalize first letter of both the string & print them separated by spaces.


Sample Input:

hello
java
Sample Output:

9
No
Hello Java
