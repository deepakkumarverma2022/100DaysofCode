In this program simply performed selection sort on a given array as input.
In the first line of input taken from the user is the size of the array.
Now in the second line of input taken the element in an array from the user and then sort it.
Runs two loop for j & k, first loop taken variable as j runs for n-1 times & the second loop k runs for n times starting from k = j as it,
check the minimum element after the element in an array which has been sorted.
And we have taken minimum element as j in the beginning.
After that runs a if condition in which compares that if a[k] < a[minInd] then k being the new minimum element in that i th iteration.
After closing if condition & k for loop, swap the element of an array accordingly.
And then runs for each loop for printing the sorted element of an array.
