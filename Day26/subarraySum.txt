Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, 
find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S and return the left and right index(1-based indexing) of that subarray.

In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray indexes which comes first on moving from left to right.

Note:- Both the indexes in the array should be according to 1-based indexing. You have to return an arraylist consisting of two elements left and right. 
In case no such subarray exists return an array consisting of element -1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A[] = {1,2,3,7,5}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements 
from 2nd position to 4th position 
is 12.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 10, S = 15
A[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
Output: 1 5
Explanation: The sum of elements 
from 1st position to 5th position
is 15.

Explanation :
Simply initialized sum variable with 0 & took start & end variable & to them also initialized with 0, after that we have to return the arraylist for the 
starting & ending subarray position whose sum is equal to the s (number taken as an input for subarraySum), so we made a Integer type arraylist. 
And then started a for loop from i = 0 till less than n & started adding sum of the array in sum variable & in the next line updated end value by i that is end = i;
Then runs a while loop in which we are checking for the conditions while(sum > s), if it is then start minusing starting array element from the sum by using 
sum -= arr[start]; & incrementing start value by 1 each time while loop gets execute i.e. till sum value is greater than s, after that closing while loop 
And then checks for the condition if(sum == s) then break; that is when sum of the subarray is equal to the desired number i.e. s, then loop will not execute further, 
end of the statement closing if statement, closing for loop & now checking for a condition when sum is not equal to s or start > end then we will return -1,
else will return the arraylist of position left & right of subarray whose sum is equal to the desired number i.e. s.
