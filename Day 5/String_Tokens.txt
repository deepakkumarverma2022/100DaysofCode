In this program I have taken string s as an input and then stored splitted tokens around the regular expression 
using split & trim function in a array of string b.
And then checked if (s.trim().isEmpty()) then print "0"
Otherwise print the length of the array.
And in the last runs a for each loop & stored the elements of array b in a variable a after that printed it.


Sample Input

He is a very very good boy, isn't he?
Sample Output

10
He
is
a
very
very
good
boy
isn
t
he

Explanation

We consider a token to be a contiguous segment of alphabetic characters.
There are a total of 10 such tokens in string s, and each token is printed in the same order in which it appears in string s.
