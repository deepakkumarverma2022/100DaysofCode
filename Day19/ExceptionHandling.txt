You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator.
Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int).
This method takes two integers,n and p, as parameters and finds n^p. 
If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n or p should not be negative". 
Also, if both n and p are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should not be zero."

Just then taken two integer value as input & starts try catch block, in try block first checked whether n & p both are equal to 0.
If it is equal to zero then,
throw new Exception ("java.lang.Exception: n and p should not be zero.");
Similarly checked either of n or p is less than 0 then,
throw new Exception ("java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.");
else
calculated it's power by Math.pow function.
And returns it.
Then again after that runs catch block and in that handled Exception e & returns e.getMessage();
Inorder to print what Exception was coming.
