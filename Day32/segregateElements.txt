In this question you are given an unsorted array arr[] of size N having both negative and positive integers. 
The task is place all negative element at the end of array without changing the order of positive element and negative element.

Sample Input : 
N = 8
arr[] = {1, -1, 3, 2, -7, -5, 11, 6 }
Sample Output : 
1  3  2  11  6  -1  -7  -5

Your task is to complete the function segregateElements() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as inputs and store the answer in the array arr[] itself.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Explanation :
In this question I have simply taken two arrayList i.e. numbers & num, first arrayList is for storing positive numbers & that of second is for storing negative
numbers than runs a for loop from 0 to n-1; and checked for a if condition i.e. if (arr[i] > 0) means positive number than stored that number in first arrayList
using add() function, similarly in the else block.
Then after the for loop gets executed using addAll() function added num arrayList to numbers & then using get() function fetch all the i^th position of number arrayList
and stored it in the same array i.e. arr[].
