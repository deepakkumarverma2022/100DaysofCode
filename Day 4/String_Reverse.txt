In this program i have taken a string as an input in a variable A, and then taken a another variable B & stored the converted
lower case string of variable A in it. Then taken a empty variable rev which store the reversed string using charAt function.
After that runs a loop which is from length of the input string - 1 till 0,
And checked whether the string which has been reversed is equals to the input string or not.
If it is equal to it then, the string is palindrome otherwise it is not palindrome.


A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.

Given a string A, print Yes if it is a palindrome, print No otherwise.

Constraints

A will consist at most 50 lower case english letters.
