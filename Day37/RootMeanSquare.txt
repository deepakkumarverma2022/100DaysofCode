In this question you have to find the RootMeanSquare of the number taken as an input in an array,
where a is the name of the array & n is the number of element in an array.

Sample Input :

N = 5
67
45
67
89
43

Sample Output :

64.45618742724588

Explanation :
First of all N is the size of the array taken then runs a for loop till less than n for taking number as an input in an array.
As we are taking number as an input along with that only squaring that number using Math.pow() function in which we are passing a[i], 2 which we are storing,
it in a double data type then after that sum = sum + square of every number & storing all the sum in the sum variable which we have initialized by 0 globally.
Then closing of for loop. Again calculated mean by dividing whole sum by n;
In the last calculated SquareRoot of that mean value using Math.sqrt() function in which we are passing mean value, and then printed SquareRoot of all the number
taken as an input in an array.
