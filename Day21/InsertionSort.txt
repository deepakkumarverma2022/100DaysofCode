In this program simply performed Insertion Sort by taking input from the user.
i.e. size of the array & number of element in an array, by using Scanner Class.

Now, normally two loop will run one (for loop) for sorted array and another (while loop) for unsorted array.
so this is the mechanism on which insertion sort work, as the first element in the beginning is always sorted for the first iteration.

So the first loop will run from index 1 till n-1, this is what the unsorted sublist in the array as the first element in an array is always sorted so, 
We have left that element for comparing on the basis of what we will do swapping.
And now element at index 1 we will be storing it in temp variable, and then decrementing the value of "j" by 1 & storing it in variable "k", which we have taken variable 
for running (for loop), so that after this when we will run (while loop) for sorted sublist which is one index before from where the unsorted sublist starts.
So that we can compare it from the previous(sorted) element of the array & sort it at it's appropriate place.

So, here we will be running one while loop(k >= 0 && a[k] > temp), which is checking first k >= 0, and second thing first element in the sorted sublist from right
is greater than the value storede in temp variable, if it is so swap the element & it will compare/check till "k" becomes 0, and like this it works & you get element
sorted in an array by using this algorithm.
