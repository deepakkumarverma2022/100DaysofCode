This is a program of matrix multiplication, In this program using Scanner class taken input from the user for the dimension of the two array.
That is rows & cols for the first matrix & ROWS & COLS for the second matrix.
Then, runs two for loop for rows & cols to take input of the element of array1 from the user, and similarly for the array2 which is named m1[][] & m2[][].
Now created another array3 named result[][] in which we are going to store element after multiplication of two matrix.
So, again runs a loop for i & j & then empty array3 to get store the element after multiplying each rows & column of first & second matrix i.e. result[i][j] = 0;
And then runs one more loop using variable as k so that it should be multiplied in that manner that first row of first matrix should be multiplied with the first
column of second matrix and then again first row of first matrix multiplied with the second column of second matrix.
And so on. 
With the code of result[i][j] += m1[i][k] * m2[k][j];
And then end of for loop & again in the else block of if(cols == ROWS) i.e. for the first if condition will print "Matrix cannot be multiplied", if column of first
matrix is not equal to the ROWS of second one.
