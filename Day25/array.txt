In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

Input Format:
There will be two lines containing two numbers,a and b.

Output Format:
Output two lines. The first line should contain a + b, and the second line should contain a * b. Don't print any leading zeros.

Sample Input

1234
20
Sample Output

1254
24680

Explanation:
1234 + 20 = 1254
1234 * 20 = 24680

In this program we have simply taken two BigInteger number as input in BigInteger data types 
as the number taken as input would be so huge that it can't be stored in normal datatypes 
like long, int & after that used a.add(b) & a.multiply(b) function taken vr variable name to store the sum of the two huge number,
and vc variable name to store multiplication of two huge number.
After that using System.out.println to print the sum & multiplication of that number in two different lines.
