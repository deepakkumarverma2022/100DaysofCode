In this questions you have to write code for the following two programs

Sample Input :
N = 5 (For 1st example)  N = 6 (For 2nd example)

Sample Output :
1) * * * * *          2) **
   * * * *               * *
   * * *                 ***
   * *                   * *
   *                     * *
   *                     * *
   * *
   * * *
   * * * * 
   * * * * *
   
Explanation :
For the first program runs a for loop from 1 to less than equal to row, where row was 2*n;
And runs another for loop before that checked a if condition i.e. if(i <= n), it will print a for loop from j = i to j <= n;
And when this if condition gets false another for loop k = n; k < i; this loop will work till the first for loop i.e. i <= row; condition gets false.
And will print the following stars.
Afterthat for line change System.out.println() & here the programs being executed.

For another program first printed the two stars, after that runs a for loop from 2 to less than equal to n as we already have printed stars for the first line.
And then checks a if condition that if(i == n/2) print the stars without space otherwise print it with space & then line change.
